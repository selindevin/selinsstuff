Her doctoral research explores remembering the 2000s and the punk scenes of Ankara and Madrid, with a focus on place, space, and sociability.\nApart from sociology and experimenting with ethnographic fieldwork, she’s interested in cinema, film-watching experiences today, and the philosophy/ontology of cinema. She wrote a master’s thesis on the ghostly nature of cinema and ghost films.\nBesides her academic texts and ideas, she translates books such as The Last Days of Roger Federer and organizes alternative city tours, mainly in Barcelona and Madrid. Her way of exploring “off-the-track” destinations during personal walks is open to and available for public.\n"}]
