It examines the experiences of participants who lived through these scenes, focusing on how their recollections of changing cityscapes relate to practices of sociability and the use of public space. It aims to recover the vanishing memory of the places and spaces that once were part of the scene, through personal stories. These narratives offer insights into shared histories and collective memory, linking the past and present in ways that continue to resonate with many who experienced them.\nDownload\nAN EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO (UN)COMMON GHOSTS OF FINISTERRAE# What comes after life has been among the existential questions in philosophy and literature. Cinema, by the virtue of its medium, has the feature of screening what is impossible to show in our world with the tools that belong to this world. Thanks to cinema, impossible appears to be possible on the screen regarding space and time as well as regarding the questionable presence of metaphysical beings. A film taking afterlife and/or ghosts as its main theme deals with invisible or non-existing objects; filming these objects is materializing what is immaterial. Being in between \u0026ldquo;life and death\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fantasy and reality\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;past and present\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;here and there\u0026rdquo; is usually among the main issues of a ghost film. In this thesis, my main purpose is to understand the depiction of a ghost by comparing the relationship between the cinematic image and the narrative by the example of an unusual ghost film: Finisterrae (Sergio Caballero, 2010). I will concentrate on the topics of life-likeness of an afterlife depiction in this particular ghost film example and existentialism to reveal the communication between the image and the narrative. Additionally, mainly Jean-Paul Sartre\u0026rsquo;s existentialism will be interpreted by comparing the ghosts in his screenplay The Chips Are Down (1948) and the ghosts that are depicted in Finisterrae.
